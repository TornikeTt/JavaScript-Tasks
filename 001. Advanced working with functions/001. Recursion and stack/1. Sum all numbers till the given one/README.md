### Problem Description

This repository contains solutions for calculating the sum of integers from 1 to `n` using three different approaches:

1. **Using a For Loop**  
   A straightforward iterative method that utilizes a `for` loop to accumulate the sum.

2. **Using Recursion**  
   An elegant recursive solution where `sumTo(n) = n + sumTo(n-1)` for `n > 1`. This approach demonstrates the power of recursive functions.

3. **Using the Arithmetic Progression Formula**  
   An optimized approach leveraging the arithmetic progression formula to compute the sum directly.
