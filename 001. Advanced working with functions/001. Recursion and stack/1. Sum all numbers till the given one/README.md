This repository contains solutions for calculating the sum of integers from 1 to n using three different approaches:

Using a For Loop
A straightforward iterative method that utilizes a for loop to accumulate the sum.

Using Recursion
An elegant recursive solution where sumTo(n) = n + sumTo(n-1) for n > 1. This approach demonstrates the power of recursive functions.

Using the Arithmetic Progression Formula
An optimized approach leveraging the arithmetic progression formula to compute the sum directly.
